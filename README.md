- [ ] Bread Armor
  - [X] Takes damage every few seconds - water speeds up this process and lava completely destroys whatever it touches
  - [X] Each piece will keep your hunger from going below a certain point (+1 cumulative)
  - [ ] Doped bread/armor set
    - [ ] Any piece of the set can be crafted with a potion to change its color and grant that effect to you while it's equipped
      - [X] Effect(s) are only applied with amplification I, further amplification increases the range your effect gets applied to fellow players

  - [ ] Pickaxe
  - [ ] Shovel
  - [ ] Hoe
  - [ ] Axe
  - [ ] Sword
  - [ ] Reinforced Variants of tools
    - Similar to netherite or diamond, faster than diamond but once again weaker in durability and strength

    - [ ] Textures
      - would be funny if the bread sword was just a long piece of bread attached to a sword handle
    - [ ] Recipes
    - [ ] Lang datagen
    - [ ] Model datagen
    - [ ] Balance Tool stats against wood/stone, diamond/netherite for reinforced

  - [X] You get 6 bread slices per bread in the recipe
  - [ ] Bread crumbs
    - Crafted from splitting toast in a crafting table
    - Usable as birdseed, provides a fraction of the saturation a full loaf does

- [ ] Joke item: "the ultimate bread" just gives you creative mode lmao
- [ ] "Bread amulet" gives you 1 hunger point every 10 seconds
- [ ] "Godlike loaf" a monstrous combination of rare materials and a nether star to give you 10 full minutes of positive potion effects and a whole 10 absorption hearts
- [ ] "Farmhouse structure" a random house with a farm attached to it with a random amount of bread or wheat in loot chests
- [ ] "Reinforced bread armor" basically bread armor except it doesn't dissolve in water and is comparable to diamond armor, high enchantability
- [ ] "Bread tools and weapons" tools and weapons have stats comparable to stone tools, can be upgraded to their Reinforced variant for a much stronger / longer lasting item\
